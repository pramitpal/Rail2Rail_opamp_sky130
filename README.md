Rail-Rail Opamp using sky130nm PDK

Rail-to-rail opamps, with input/output and high-speed operation make them ideal for driving sampling Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC). They are also well suited for general-purpose and audio applications and providing I/V conversion at the output of igital-to-Analog Converters(DAC). 
They are optimized to operate on a single supply as low as 1.8V with an input common-mode voltage range that extends all the way to the supplies.

## Skywater 130 pdk
The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.

## Rail-to-Rail opamp 3.3v
The schematic for the 3.3v version is shown below

To draw the layout using magic VLSI tool. it needs to be invoked by
```
magic -rcfile sky130A.magicrc -d XR
```
